# Roam Navigator

When you Roam freely, it is essential to have an efficient navigator.

## Why is this not part of the Roam Toolkit? Answer:

I'd already written very similar code in my [todoist-shortcuts][]
extension. I considered making this an addition to [roam-toolkit][],
but on initial skim it has very different conventions, probably
superior ones, such as using TypeScript, [not using mousetrap][], not
having key sequences with modifiers held, and supporting user
configuration.

Quite simply, since I have a bunch of existing code I'm familiar with,
it will take a fraction of the effort for me to copy-modify it for
this purpose, when compared with adding it to an existing and
excellent extension such as [roam-toolkit][] while fitting in with the
conventions of that project.
