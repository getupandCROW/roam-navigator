# Roam Navigator

Wherever you may [Roam](https://roamresearch.com/) :metal:, it is
essential to have an efficient navigator.

By default, navigation mode will be active when no input is focused.
It can also be initiated by pressing `alt-g`, or just `g` when not
editing text. Visual navigation keys will then appear, allowing you to
select links, starred pages, and select blocks to edit.

In order to shift-click links to pages, hold `Shift` while pressing
the last letter of the visual navigation key.

While navigating, the following shortcuts will also be available:

* `Space` to scroll down half a page

* `Shift+Space` to scroll up half a page

* `Down Arrow` to scroll down a bit

* `Up Arrow` to scroll up a bit

* To scroll the sidebar, first type `s` followed one of the above
  scrolling shortcuts.
